# Netflix-Dashboard-
Welcome to my Netflix Dashboard, where data meets entertainment! 📊🍿
This interactive Power BI dashboard provides deep insights into Netflix’s extensive content library. Using a Kaggle dataset, I explored trends in genres, release patterns, top-rated content, country-wise production, and popularity analysis.

Project Highlights
✅ Built with Power BI – Designed an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.
✅ Data Cleaning with Power Query – Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.
✅ Explored Key Trends – Analyzed genre distribution, content production over the years, and country-wise trends.
✅ Applied DAX Calculations – Used custom formulas for advanced insights.
✅ Created Interactive Visualizations – Provided dynamic filtering and insights based on multiple parameters.

Project Overview
Netflix is one of the largest streaming platforms, with a vast catalog of movies and TV shows across multiple genres and countries. This project aims to analyze Netflix’s content library and answer important questions such as:
How has Netflix’s content evolved over the years?
Which genres are most popular?
Which countries produce the most content?
What are the highest-rated movies and series?
How does runtime and release year impact content popularity?
By leveraging Power BI’s data visualization capabilities, this dashboard provides clear, actionable insights for data analysts, business intelligence professionals, and movie enthusiasts.

Key Features & Insights
🔹 Genre-wise Content Distribution – Understand which genres dominate Netflix’s catalog.
🔹 Yearly Content Trends (Movies vs. TV Shows) – See how Netflix’s content library has expanded over time.
🔹 Top-Rated Movies & Series – Identify the most critically acclaimed content based on ratings.
🔹 Country-wise Content Production – Discover which countries contribute the most content.
🔹 Popularity Analysis – Examine trends based on runtime, release year, and engagement.
🔹 Dynamic Filtering – Users can filter data based on year, genre, country, and ratings to get customized insights.

Data Cleaning Process (ETL)
Before visualizing data, I cleaned and preprocessed it using Power Query in Power BI. The steps included:

🛠 1. Handling Missing Values
✔ Removed duplicate records.
✔ Filled or removed missing values in title, genre, and country columns.
✔ Replaced null values in release year and rating columns with appropriate values.

🏷 2. Standardizing Data Formats
✔ Converted date formats to ensure consistency.
✔ Cleaned categorical values (e.g., merging similar genre names).

🔄 3. Data Transformation
✔ Extracted year from the date column for trend analysis.
✔ Created new calculated fields like Movie vs. TV Show classification.
✔ Categorized movies by runtime to analyze duration-based patterns.

📊 4. Feature Engineering
✔ Created custom measures using DAX for advanced insights.
✔ Generated ranking measures to identify top-performing content.
✔ Built interactive slicers and filters for dynamic analysis.

These steps ensured the dataset was clean, structured, and ready for visualization in Power BI.
